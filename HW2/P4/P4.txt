Discussion:

The resuts below indicate that runtime approximately halves as the number
of threads doubles. This makes sense because each thread works independently
on different rows in the image. 

I control cooperation between threads by creating an array of Events with 
length equal to the number of threads. Each thread sets the corresponding 
Event after the filtering. The main thread can only finish an iteration once
all 4 Events are set, at which point the main thread clears all 4 Events for 
the next iteration which then is allowed to start. 

Results:

Num Threads:  1
3.32647919655 seconds for 10 filter passes.

Num Threads:  2
1.72211122513 seconds for 10 filter passes.

Num Threads:  4
0.958344936371 seconds for 10 filter passes.
