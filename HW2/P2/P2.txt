Discussion:

The serial version performs faster than the fine and medium grained lock versions 
(both use 4 threads). In this case, the time to set and unset locks and the collision 
wait times involved between threads accessing the same memory locations outweighed 
the speedups from multithreading. The fine grained version with correlated data
performs faster than the fine grained version with uncorrelated data because there 
are less collisions between threads with correlated data. This is because source and 
destinations are at most 10 apart and the source and destination arrays are divided 
into 4 contiguous equal segments between the threads. 

For the medium grained case, performance gets better as the number of adjacent elements
managed by 1 lock (N) gets smaller because smaller N results in less memory collisions 
between threads. Since the source and destination pairs are at most 10 apart, making N 
much larger than 10 leads to too many unnecessary locking collisions between threads 
and thus slower runtime. The medium grained version performs faster on the correlated
data because there is less of a chance of source/destination indices in separate threads 
intersecting (higher probability of 4 independent numbers intersecting than 2 correlated
pairs intersecting). A good N to choose for the correlated case is 10 and a good N to 
choose for the uncorrelated case is 5. Both of these points are when the returns start to 
diminish as N decreases.
